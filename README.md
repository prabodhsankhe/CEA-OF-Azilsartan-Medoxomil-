# CEA-OF-Azilsartan-Medoxomil-
Cost-Effectiveness of the Interventions Comparing Azilsartan Medoxomil with Losartan and Valsartan â€“ Class of Antihypertensive drugs.

Background: Hypertension is a leading global health issue, affecting over 1.4 billion individuals and contributing to significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Among the treatments, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are a key class of antihypertensive medications. Azilsartan medoxomil, losartan, and valsartan are ARBs with varying efficacy, safety, and cost profiles.

Objective: This study aims to compare azilsartan medoxomil with losartan and valsartan, focusing on cost-effectiveness, clinical efficacy, epidemiology, disease burden, health service utilization, and their impact on unmet needs in hypertension management.

Methods: Cost-effectiveness was analyzed using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), cost-effectiveness planes, and direct and indirect cost comparisons. Clinical efficacy and health services utilization were derived from meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials. Epidemiological trends were reviewed from population studies to assess demographic and obesity-related hypertension prevalence.

Results: Azilsartan medoxomil demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing blood pressure and lowering healthcare costs due to fewer hospitalizations and improved adherence. It also addressed unmet needs by improving tolerability and patient satisfaction. Trends indicated a rising prevalence of obesity-related hypertension, particularly in high-income countries.
